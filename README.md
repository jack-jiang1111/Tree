NFT Growth System 🌱 → 🌸 → 🌳
For 100,000 tokens, users can mint an NFT, which starts as a Seed and progresses to a Flower and finally a Tree. This growth represents the user's commitment to eco-tourism, adding a unique, visual way to engage with the project.

Staking
By staking tokens, users can earn additional rewards from the Staking Reward Pool, incentivizing them to hold tokens, support project liquidity, and engage more deeply in the ecosystem.
